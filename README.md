- **Mental Support**

To make mental support seeking anonymous, students are promoted to choose a helper rather than the helper picking a seeker. Students can seek mental support by choosing the second option in the seek page where they'll get directed to a list of approveed listeners that they can contact by clicking on their preferred social app
