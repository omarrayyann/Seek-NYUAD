*Note: Please email me at olr7742@nyu.edu if you want to see the app on a physical device, I can come give you the device as apple doesn't allow testing apps on other devices before they review it in a process that takes 24-48 hours*

Prioritizing mental health while performing well academically can be challenging for students, this app can help students achieve that. SEEK NYUAD aims to tackle both the **Academic** and **Health** stress of students on campus, especially in these times where in-person classes are scarce.

To begin with, students are prompted to Sign in using their Netids and provide at least one mean of contact. Next, useres are taken to the App's Home Page.

# Types of Support/Help

- **Academic Support**

Students can seek help academically by submitting a request to the seek page after describing the issue they're facing.

Students can find other students enquiries in the help section and can offer help through one of the means of contact the seeker provided when signing in.

- **Mental Support**

In order for mental support seeking to be somewhat anonymous, students are prompted to choose a listener rather than posting a public request. Students can seek mental support by choosing the second option in the seek page where they will get directed to a list of approveed listeners whom they can contact.

Students who want to become listeners can apply through the app where they will get the testing and preperation requried through an email. Once completed and approved, the studenet will be added to the list of approved listeners
