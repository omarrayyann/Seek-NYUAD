Prioritizing mental health while performing well academically can be challenging for students, this app can help students achieve that. SEEK NYUAD aims to tackle both the **Academic** and **Health** stress of students on campus, especially in these times where in-person classes are limited.

To begin with, students are prompted to Sign in using their Netids and provide at least one mean of contact. Next, users are taken to the App's Home Page.

- **Mental Health Support**

In order for mental health support seeking to be somewhat anonymous, students are prompted to choose a listener rather than posting a public request. Students can seek mental health support by choosing the second option in the seek page where they will get directed to a list of approved listeners to contact.

Students who want to become listeners can apply through the app where they will get the testing and preperation requried through an email. Once completed and approved, the studenet will be added to the list of approved listeners.
